# Contributing

Contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the
process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Sign off Your Work

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors
to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they
are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the
[DCO](http://developercertificate.org/). Contributors must sign-off that they
adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit
messages.

```text
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

See `git help commit`:

```text
-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```
